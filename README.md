# Case Study: Crop Prediction

Farming is an important industry for any economy, especially the Indian economy, and hence it becomes a necessity to maximise the profits procured from it. A detailed analysis, though, suggests that it is highly imperative to take into consideration the nutrient contents of the soil and the climatic conditions of the area that the farming activity is to be undertaken at. Not choosing the correct crop to grow based on the above factors can lead to suboptimal yield or even severe depletion of essential nutrients in the soil.

Fertilisers are one of the most important resources that can be used in the process of growing crops, providing essential nutrients for the growing crops. Hence, it becomes highly imperative to pick the correct fertiliser based on the crop being grown, the soil it is being grown in and other environmental factors. Selecting the correct fertiliser can optimise crop yield, hence increasing profit margins, and clubbing these with the optimal selection of crop to grow also helps to maintain the profile of the soil, making the approach highly sustainable.


# What is so good about us?

Here at VGrow, we streamline the process of recommending the type of crop to grow based on varied factors, whilst maintaining an easy to navigate user interface for an optimal user experience.

VGrow offers two main features to ensure that maximum user requirements are met. 
Firstly, we offer a feature to predict the top 3 crops that can be viable options to be grown, depending on the location, time period and soil profile that has been entered by the user. 
The second feature is the ability to predict the fertiliser to be used, depending on the soil profile, location, time period and crop to be grown.


Now we are taking this time to introduce you guys with the web thing of our company which is basically a website.

# Description of VGrow

The user will only have to enter a few fields that include their location, soil profile and time period to receive a list of recommendations of which crops can be viably grown in that region, within the specified amount of time. There will also be an option to predict the optimal fertiliser to be used, given the above data, in addition to the crop being grown. The website offers a simple and easily navigable user interface that makes these predictive algorithms more accessible. In addition, the user will be able to switch between languages based on their preferences, so as to ensure that language is no barrier to access this information.
